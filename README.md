💼**Work Experience**


**University of Missouri-Kansas | Kansas City, MO, USA**

Jan 2025 – Oct 2025 

_Graduate Research Assistant_

●	Conducted literature review on lightweight CNN architectures and quantization techniques, and worked with the supervising professor to define the research scope and evaluation goals.

●	Prepared and cleaned large plant leaf image datasets by performing resizing, augmentation, normalization, and automated labeling using custom Python preprocessing scripts.

●	Assisted in building the lightweight CNN model by developing data loaders, feature extraction routines, and quantization steps to reduce computation cost while maintaining accuracy.

●	Supported model training and tuning efforts by adjusting hyperparameters, performing validation runs, and analyzing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and loss patterns.

●	Developed Spring Boot backend APIs to wrap the trained model for real-time inference, enabling the team to test predictions through a secure and modular service layer.

●	Deployed the inference system on AWS using EC2 and S3 for scalable model hosting, dataset storage, and cloud-based testing of quantized model performance.

●	Built a simple React.js interface that allowed users to upload leaf images, trigger predictions, and view disease classification results interactively.

●	Documented architectural decisions, quantization results, and testing outcomes, and contributed to the professor’s research reports aligning with the published Springer work. 


**Tata Consultancy Services | Hyderabad, Telangana**

Aug 2021 – Dec 2022 

_Software Developer_

●	Developed and deployed cloud-based healthcare applications using Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, and REST APIs, optimizing patient data retrieval speed by 35%, reducing wait times for critical reports, and enabling real-time access for doctors and hospital staff across multiple facilities.

●	Engineered real-time event-driven pipelines for lab results, medical device telemetry, and patient monitoring using Apache Kafka and JMS, cutting information update delays from hours to under 5 minutes, significantly improving response times for urgent care scenarios.

●	Built responsive clinician dashboards using Typescript, React.js, and Tailwind CSS, improving workflow efficiency and accessibility, allowing secure access to patient records for over 2,000 users, and providing actionable insights for hospital administrators.

●	Automated CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, Docker, GitLab, and Maven, reducing release cycles from 4 hours to 1 hour, minimizing deployment errors, and ensuring seamless delivery of updates to multiple healthcare applications simultaneously.

●	Integrated applications with EHR/EMR systems, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and third-party healthcare platforms via secure APIs, enhancing interoperability, reducing manual data entry by 30%, and improving overall operational accuracy and efficiency.

●	Implemented security and compliance frameworks including OAuth 2.0, JWT, RBAC, and encryption protocols, safeguarding sensitive patient information, ensuring HIPAA compliance, and reducing unauthorized access incidents by 40%.

●	Collaborated with global Agile/Scrum teams, conducted L2/L3 production support, troubleshot critical system issues, and optimized patient-facing features, increasing system uptime and availability to 99.8%, improving service continuity.

●	Designed and implemented data validation, logging, and monitoring strategies using ELK Stack, Prometheus, and Grafana across backend services, identifying anomalies efficiently, reducing downtime incidents, and ensuring consistent, high-quality delivery of healthcare services.
